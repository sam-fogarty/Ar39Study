 0. Draw candidate map?
 1. Random selection? Use this if you want to sample noise.
 2. This is an outdated parameter and can be removed at some point.
 3. This is the Threshold in ADCs.
 4. This is a Standard Deviation threshold used to throw out dead channels.
 5. This is the horizontal (wires) integration window parameter.
 6. This is the vertical (time ticks) integration window parameter. 
 7. This is the buffer size (in wires) between the integration window and the check region.
 8. This is the buffer size (in time ticks) between the integ. window and the chack region.
 9. This is the width (in wires) of each side of the check region.
10. This is the width (in time ticks) of the top and bottom of the check region.
11. This is the max events.
12. This is the max events per run.
13. This is the track exclusion window parameter used to draw bubbles around tracks.
14. This is the MCCx number. This is important because some data products change.
15. This is the detector (0 == MicroBooNE; 1 == ProtoDUNE)
16. This is the input data tag to select which product will be analyzed.
17. This is a scale factor used to solve a rounding bug in some rawdigit products. 


This parameter file is not the best way to do this. Eventually, I want to get everything 
either hard-coded or input through FHICL if this gets reimplemented in LArSoft.
